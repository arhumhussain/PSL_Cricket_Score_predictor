# PSL Cricket Score Predictor


This project aims to predict match scores and winning probabilities for Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches using machine learning models. It leverages a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and includes detailed analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training to produce accurate predictions.


## Features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into match statistics, team performance, player impact, and other crucial factors that influence match outcomes.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the total match score and the winning team.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and accuracy measures to evaluate model performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations to understand key trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing match data, team statistics, and player performances from multiple PSL seasons.

## Installation:
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required Python libraries by running:
```bash
git clone <repo-link>
cd PSL_Cricket_Score_predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:
After setting up, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data analysis process or run the prediction models on new PSL match data.

## Future Work:
- Enhance the model by incorporating live match data.
- Build a real-time prediction dashboard for ongoing PSL matches.
- Extend the analysis to player performance predictions and fantasy league recommendations.
